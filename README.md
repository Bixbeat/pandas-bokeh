# pandas-bokeh
This repository contains the scripts written while I was exploring pandasql and Bokeh. All scripts herein are freely usable by anyone. If you do end up using it, it would be nice to let me know what and how you used it.

The Jupyter workbook contains the code segmented per function with a brief explanation of how it works. It displays the plot as shown on my website, and is thus limited to five points and 500 entries per point. This can, of course, be removed if desired.

The Python script contains the code to run all of the points at once. Since processing times are very high (approx. 30 minutes for the full set), you'll have to let it run for a while. It is believed that this is due to Pandas/pandasql processing time.

The HTML file contains the raw HTML file shown on my site.
